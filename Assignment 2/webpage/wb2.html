         LIFE WITH WATSON:
      </h4>
      <p class="para"><img id="img1" src="Martin_Freeman.jpg" alt="" title="Martin Freeman">
         I shared most of my professional years with narrator John Watson, a physician who lived with me for some time before his 1887 marriage and again after his wife's death. Our residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Most of the stories are frame narratives, written from Watson's point of view as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. I frequently called Watson's writing sensational and populist, suggesting that it fails to accurately and objectively report the "science" of his craft:
         Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it ["A Study in Scarlet"] with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story... Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.
         —Sherlock Holmes on John Watson's "pamphlet", The Sign of the Four
         Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. In "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs", Watson is injured; although the bullet wound turns out to be "quite superficial", Watson is moved by Holmes' reaction:
         It was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.
         According to "The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger" Holmes was in active practice for 23 years, with Watson co-operating with him for 17 years.

         "GREAT HIATUS":
      </h4>
      <p class="para">Conan Doyle wrote the first set of stories over the course of a decade. Wanting to devote more time to his historical novels, he killed off Holmes in "The Final Problem", which appeared in print in 1893 but is set in 1891. After resisting public pressure for eight years, the author wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles, which appeared in 1901, implicitly setting it before Holmes's "death" (some theorise that it actually took place after "The Return" but with Watson planting clues to an earlier date).In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote "The Adventure of the Empty House", set in 1894, in which Holmes reappears and explains to a shocked Watson that he had only faked his death in "The Final Problem" to fool his enemies. "The Adventure of the Empty House" marks the beginning of the second set of stories, which Conan Doyle continued to write until 1927.
         Holmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—the time between Holmes's disappearance and presumed death in "The Final Problem" and his reappearance in "The Adventure of the Empty House"—as the "Great Hiatus". One later story ("A Reminiscence of Sherlock Holmes" later "The Adventure of Wiseria Lodge"), though, is described as taking place in 1892, although this can be explained as a mistake on Conan Doyle's part.

         RETIREMENT:
      </h4>
      <p class="para">
         In "His Last Bow", Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs. The move is not dated precisely but can be presumed to predate 1904, since it is referred to retrospectively in "The Second Stain", first published that year. Here he has taken up the hobby of beekeeping as his primary occupation, eventually producing a "Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen". The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the war effort. Only one other adventure, "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane", narrated by Holmes, takes place during the detective's retirement. The details of his death are not known.
